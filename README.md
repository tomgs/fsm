# Finite State Machine Designer - Now With A Save Option!

The original [Finite State Machine Designer](https://github.com/evanw/fsm), published on http://madebyevan.com/fsm/, is truly awesome aside from two main bugs: The PNG export does not work properly, and you cannot save and load diagrams.

The former one matters little to me, but the latter is a bit annoying. Solution: Add a JSON save/load feature.
